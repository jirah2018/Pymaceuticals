# Pymaceuticals
This assignment Pymaceuticals Inc., a new new Pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. It began screening for potential treatments

for squamous cell carcinoma(SCC), a commonly occuring form of cancer. In this study,249 mice who ere identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range

of drug regime. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceutical's drug interest,Capomulin, aggainst the other treatment regimens.

The following tasks has been made

*Summary statistics dataframe

*Bar plot showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study

*Pie chart showing the distribution of female or male mice in the study

*Box plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens

*Line plot of volume versus timepoint for Capomulin treatmeant of mouse l509

* plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen

*Linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment plotted on top of the scatter plot

### Analysis

The Conclusions through analysis from Pymaceutical animal study suggests:

1.Out of 4 drugs Capomulin and Ramicane was the top most effective at reducing tumor sizes.

2.There is positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the tumor size with correlation value of 0.84.
